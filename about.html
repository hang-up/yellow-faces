<h1>About Us</h1>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>Yellow Faces is a web page dedicated to linking people with places based on the way they are feeling. Users will find 5 emotions represented by 5 different emojis.</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Happy? Great! We'll match you with places that will make you even happier.</li>
        <li>Love? Whether its love from your mom or your girlfriend, we'll help you find places where you can spend a good time with that special someone.</li>
        <li>Bored? Stop watching Netfilx, go on our website and we'll match you with places that will make you live life to the fullest.</li>
        <li>Stressed? Fear not! We'll help you find places that will take your mind off school or work.</li>
        <li>Sad? Don't worry! We'll match you with places that will turn that frown upside down.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>How this project came about?</h3>

<p>Yellow Faces came alive at ConUHacks 2017. Our team wanted to attract the younger generation to
    Yellow Pages so we came up with the idea of creating a web page where people could find interesting
    activites based on the way they are feeling throught emojis.</p>
